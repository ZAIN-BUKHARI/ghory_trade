            <h2>Trade in crud oil</h2>
            <p>Oil trading is the buying and selling of different types of oil and oil-linked assets with the aim of making a profit. As oil is a finite resource, its price can see massive fluctuations due to supply and demand changes. This volatility makes it extremely popular among traders.</p>

            <h2>Trade in properties</h2>
            <p>Trading investment properties has been popular for years because it gives investors the opportunity to upgrade or transfer their holdings to a new area. But the biggest plus is that it allows them to defer capital gains taxes, which are hefty taxes that Uncle Sam charges on the profits from investment properties when they're sold.</p>

            <h2>Trade in gold</h2>
            <p>Gold trading is the practice of speculating on the price of gold markets in order to make a profit – usually via futures, options, spot prices or shares and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Usually, physical gold bars or coins are not handled during the transaction; instead they are settled in cash.</p>

            <h2>Spot trading</h2>
            <p>Spot FX is the purchase or sale of forex ‘on the spot’, which means the exchange takes place at the exact point that the trade is settled. When trading spot forex, you buy and sell the currency pair at the current market rate, known as the spot price. Forex trading is a way to speculate on international currencies without taking ownership</p>
